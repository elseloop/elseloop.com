// GLOBALS
// This directory should contain all of your non-printing styles,
// allowing for a single folder that can bootstrap any new stylesheet.
// You should pretty much be able to reskin an entire website
// by updating the variables and extends

// BASE
// these act as the core skin of the project
// if you're using a css framework like Bootstrap
// or Foundation, it should go in here
@import "base/*";

// LAYOUT
// By separating layout from style, you ensure adherence to a 
// consistent grid and set the foundation for a responsive layout

// PARTIALS
// If done properly, each partial should simply be
